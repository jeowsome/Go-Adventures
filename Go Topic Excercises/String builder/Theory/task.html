<h2>String builder</h2>
<p>In Go, strings are <strong>immutable</strong>. This means that once you create a string, you can't change it.</p>
<p>If you want to modify the content of an existing string, you should create a new string. It is a working solution, but this approach becomes inefficient when you need to modify many strings. Indeed, each operation creates a new string, making our program consume more memory, which is not ideal for performance.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you can implement the <code class="language-go">Builder</code> struct type from the <code class="language-go">strings</code> package: it allows you to easily build, or <strong>concatenate</strong>, strings.</p>
<h5 id="creating-a-string-with-stringsbuilder">Creating a string with strings.Builder</h5>
<p>Suppose you wanted to concatenate or join a series of strings together without importing any additional packages apart from <code class="language-go">fmt</code>. The code required to achieve this would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func concat(strs ...string) string {
    var result string
    for _, str := range strs {
        result += str
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(concat("Hello", " World", "!")) // Hello World!
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's examine the <code class="language-go">concat</code> function; every time we call <code class="language-go">result += str</code>, a new string gets allocated in memory. As previously mentioned, this happens because strings in Go are immutable, so every time you change, add, or remove contents from a string, a new string gets created.</p>
<p>To make the program more memory efficient, it's better to avoid creating new strings whenever you need to change or modify one. You can achieve this by using the <code class="language-go">strings.Builder</code> struct type, along with its <code class="language-go">WriteString()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func concat(strs ...string) string {
    var b strings.Builder
    for _, s := range strs {
        b.WriteString(s)
    }
    return b.String()
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(concat("Hello", " World", "!")) // Hello World!
}</code></pre>
<p>The updated <code class="language-go">concat</code> function implements the <code class="language-go">b</code> variable of the <code class="language-go">strings.Builder</code> type. After that, we call the <code class="language-go">WriteString()</code> method within the <code class="language-go">for...range</code> loop to start appending the contents of <code class="language-go">s</code> to the buffer of <code class="language-go">b</code>. This way, you can concatenate the strings passed to the builder without creating a new string every time. Finally, the call to the <code class="language-go">String()</code> method returns the previously accumulated string.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Even though a builder doesn't create a new string every time you change a string, it still allocates new memory for the buffer of the builder to append data to it. In general, using a builder is optimal when you need to concatenate 3 or more strings. We'll take a look at how a builder manages its buffer data further in this topic.</div>
<h5 id="additional-data-writing-helpers">Additional data writing helpers</h5>
<p>Apart from the <code class="language-go">WriteString()</code> method, the <code class="language-go">strings.Builder</code> type supports three additional methods to write data to the builder: <code class="language-go">Write()</code>, <code class="language-go">WriteRune()</code> and <code class="language-go">WriteByte()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-go">Write()</code> method allows us to append a slice of bytes to the buffer of the builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">...

func main() {
    var b strings.Builder
    b.Write([]byte("Hello JetBrains Academy!"))

    fmt.Println(b.String()) // Hello JetBrains Academy!
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-go">WriteRune() and WriteByte()</code> methods are very similar; you can use them to append single characters to the buffer of the builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">...

func concatRunes(runes ...rune) string {
    var b strings.Builder
    for _, r := range runes {
        b.WriteRune(r)
    }
    return b.String()
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(concatRunes('e', 'm', 'o', 'j', 'i', 'ðŸ˜‚', 'ðŸ‘Œ', 'ðŸ’¯')) // emojiðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to append the UTF-8 encoding of an arbitrary rune such as an emoji, e.g., ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯, you need to use the <code class="language-go">WriteRune()</code> method. However, if you're working with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp#:~:text=ASCII%20is%20a%207%2Dbit,Z%2C%20and%20some%20special%20characters." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">standard ASCII characters</a> you can use the <code class="language-go">WriteByte()</code> method.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">If you tried to pass an emoji such as "ðŸ˜‚" to the <code class="language-go">WriteByte()</code> method, you would get the <code class="language-go">constant 128514 overflows byte</code> error since it's not a standard ASCII character.</div>
<h5 id="how-does-stringbuilder-organize-its-data">How does string.Builder organize its data?</h5>
<p>So far, you've seen the most basic <code class="language-go">string.Builder</code> use cases, but you might be wondering how the <code class="language-go">string.Builder</code> type organizes its data internally. Let's have a look.</p>
<p>A very simple explanation is that the <code class="language-go">string.Builder</code> type uses an <strong>internal buffer slice</strong> to store pieces of data. Every time you call any of the <code class="language-go">Write</code> helpers to write content, the data is appended to the buffer slice internally:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="WriteRune() method example" height="536" name="stringsBuilderRev4.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7d00aa72-b738-4510-af25-0026fbb67e4f/" width="651"/></p>
<p>The above diagram showcases the previous <code class="language-go">WriteRune()</code> method example. Initially, the buffer slice within the <code class="language-go">b</code> variable of the <code class="language-go">strings.Builder</code> type starts with a capacity of 8 bytes. After appending all the standard ASCII characters which write "emoji", the buffer still has 3 free bytes. However, when our program reads the next rune (an emoji) â€” "ðŸ˜‚",<strong> </strong>it requires 4 bytes of space.</p>
<p>Since only 3 free bytes are left, Go automatically allocates a new buffer slice with a bigger capacity, in this case, 20 bytes. Then it copies the contents of the old slice to the new one, after which it appends the emoji rune "ðŸ˜‚", followed by the remaining emoji runes â€” "ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯".</p>
<p>Take notice that Go allocates memory for the new buffer slice dynamically. This means that Go doesn't allocate the exact memory capacity required to fill the new buffer slice with the remaining emojis. Go will always allocate more memory than the exact capacity required to avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">buffer overflow</a>! Therefore, after appending the last two emojis, the buffer still ends up with 3 free bytes.</p>
<h5 id="improving-stringbuilder-performance">Improving string.Builder performance</h5>
<p>Now that you know how <code class="language-go">strings.Builder</code> organizes its data internally, let's take a look at how you can preallocate the size of the buffer slice. This way, our code won't require incrementing the allocated memory dynamically.</p>
<p>Suppose you already know the size of the final string you intend to build. You can go ahead and use the <code class="language-go">Grow()</code> method to preallocate the size of the buffer slice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">...

func main() {
    var b strings.Builder
    b.Grow(61) // We will be writing 61 bytes

    b.WriteString("Countdown to liftoff!\n") // 22 bytes written (including '\n')
    for i := 5; i &gt;= 1; i-- {
        // 5 bytes written for each line (including '\n')
        b.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("%d...\n", i))
    }
    b.WriteString("Liftoff! ðŸš€\n") // 14 bytes written (including '\n')

    fmt.Print(b.String())
    fmt.Println("Capacity of 'b' =", b.Cap())
    fmt.Println("Length of 'b' =", b.Len())
}

// Output:
// Countdown to liftoff!
// 5...
// 4...
// 3...
// 2...
// 1...
// Liftoff! ðŸš€
// Capacity of 'b' = 61
// Length of 'b' = 61</code></pre>
<p>Since you already know how many bytes each line will contain, you can simply pass <code class="language-go">61</code> bytes as an argument to the <code class="language-go">Grow()</code> method. After writing all the strings, you can print the capacity and length of <code class="language-go">b</code> with the help of the <code class="language-go">Cap()</code> and <code class="language-go">Len()</code> methods and confirm that both the capacity and length of the slice buffer within the <code class="language-go">b</code> variable are equal to <code class="language-go">61</code>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">In case you pass an incorrect amount of bytes to the <code class="language-go">Grow()</code> method, Go will automatically allocate a new buffer slice with a bigger capacity and copy the contents of the old slice to the new one, beating the purpose of using the <code class="language-go">Grow()</code> method anyway. Hence, to use the <code class="language-go">Grow()</code> method effectively, you should know the exact size or a close estimate of the final string you intend to build.</div>
