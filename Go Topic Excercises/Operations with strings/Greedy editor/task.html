<h2>Greedy editor</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine that you are a text writer. Your new editor said he didn't want to pay for the void. Now he will pay 2 cents for each letter and 1 cent for the space symbol. You are lucky that you started learning Go. Now you can do it with literally 20 lines of code.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to count all the letters in the text and then replace all the blank spaces <code class="java">" "</code> with the empty character <code class="java">""</code>, and then count them again.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Note that this method will only work with ASCII text. In it, all characters have a size of 1 byte. In other cases, you can use the <code class="java">utf8</code> package.</div>
<p>Finally, take notice that for this task, the input text only contains ASCII characters!</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">One day, the noble Jacques, who lived in Vesteros, decided to move to another continent. But Vesteros didn&#39;t want to let him go.</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Symbols in text: 106<br>Spaces in text: 22</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
