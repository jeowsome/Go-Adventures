<h2>Printing individual struct fields</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Billie Joe has been trying to learn about Go structs but he's having a really hard time! Can you help him fix his code so that he can properly print every individual field of the <code class="java">greenDay</code> struct of the <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">Band</span></code> type?</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
