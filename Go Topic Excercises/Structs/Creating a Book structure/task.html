<h2>Creating a Book structure</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Emma has just got a new job as a library assistant. Since she knows how to code in Go, she wants to write a small program that has a <code class="java">Book</code> structure with fields to store the <code class="java">Title</code>, <code class="java">Author</code>, and <code class="java">Pages</code> of the books to organize the library better.</p>
<p>Can you help her create the <code class="java">Book</code> struct with the previously mentioned fields? The <code class="java">Title</code> and <code class="java">Author</code> fields should be of the <code class="java">string</code> type and the <code class="java">Pages</code> fields should be of the <code class="java">int</code> type.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
